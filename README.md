# Tanks Game (Java)

A simple **2D tank battle game** built in **Java** using the **Processing** graphics library.  
Originally developed as part of a university assignment, this project demonstrates object-oriented programming, basic game physics, collision detection, and Gradle-based project structure.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Control your tank and battle against AI or other players.
- Move, aim, and shoot projectiles to hit opponents.
- Terrain and obstacles affect movement and shot paths.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 8
- **Build Tool:** Gradle
- **Graphics:** Processing (`org.processing:core:3.3.7`)
- **Utilities:** Google Guava
- **Testing:** JUnit 5

📚 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me develop:

    Object-Oriented Design – Classes for tanks, projectiles, game logic, and rendering.

    Event Handling – Player input and game state updates.

    Graphics Programming – Using Processing for rendering and animations.

    Build Automation – Dependency management and builds with Gradle.

    Testing – Writing and running unit tests with JUnit 5.

If you want, I can also make you a **GIF gameplay recording** from your game so recruiters see it in action right at the top of your README.  
That visual impact can make your repo stand out a lot more.
